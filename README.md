# evilEyeProjekt
This is a website I made for my friend who owns a clothing company. I had some very specific instructions how to make it, and I had
to follow them, because the site is supposed to go on the internet some day.
The main design idea behind this store is to be very minimalistic. No flashy gadgets, no useless animations, just simple 
design, and being as usefull and simple as possible. 
I used a plugin to create a working shop, so we could skip the back-end part of running an online store, and make it ready with
just using front-end tools. 
There are still old pictures on the website, some still missing, but that is supposed to change as soon, as the owner finally creates
some new products. 
I made the site responsive, it looks good on both pc's and phones/tablets. 
There's still work to be done here, and I'm really excited to work on this project, and add more cool stuff in the future.
